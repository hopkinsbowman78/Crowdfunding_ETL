# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Project Synopsis
In this project, we utilized data from two different XLSX files, which were merged to extract specific information as outlined in the Jupyter Notebook starter code. The extraction process involved tasks such as identifying subcategories, organizing data into structured DataFrames, converting data types, renaming columns, and dropping unnecessary columns. After cleaning and preparing the data, we generated new CSV files and used these to create database-ready tables.

Once the Jupyter Notebook code was finalized, we exported the processed data, resulting in four new CSV files created from the original XLSX files. These tables were subsequently loaded into a database. Additionally, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was developed to visually illustrate the relationships between the tables within the database, ensuring a clear understanding of the data structure and connections.
